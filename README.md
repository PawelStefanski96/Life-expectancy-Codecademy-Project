# Life-expectancy-Codecademy-Project

For this project, I will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Countries used in that projects are:

1. Chile
2. China
3. Germany
4. Mexico
5. USA
6. Zimbabwe

To analysie and get insights from that project I used:

- Python pandas and numpy to wrangle data and perform exploratory analysis
- Python matplotlib and seaborn libraries to develop graphs and visualisations abot data
- Python scipy.stats to develop simple regression models and hypothesis tests
